Maintained by bestgamer08 (Discord username for DMs)

# Instructions
- Copy the Otu! level (ID: comig soom).
- [Download the map importer](https://github.com/RealSput/otu-map-importer/releases) (.exe is preferred for download, but .zip could also be used if you are trying to debug)
- Import your .osu file, and then the .mp3 that goes along with it.
- Tweak advanced settings if necessary (like level name and custom song ID), however they are optional and not required if you are just trying to import any map and don't know what you are doing.
- Close GD, and then click on "Import map into GD" to import it into Otu!.
- After importing is finished, close the window, reopen GD, play the copied Otu! level, and navigate to "Map Importer" in order to play your imported Osu! map in GD.
